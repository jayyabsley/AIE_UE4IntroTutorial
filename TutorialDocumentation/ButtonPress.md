# Button Press (Interaction)
Push a button, make it do something!

In this portion we will need to make something happen when the player jumps on this huge button.

This will be a two part tutorial as this requires parallel imeplentation of the bridge that is hidden under the fog!

# Possible Implementation
 - When the Player actor overlaps the Blueprint will find all instances of a certain other blueprint.
 - We will then loop over all of the found actors and execute a function

# UE4 Engine Version
This project is using 4.20.3
