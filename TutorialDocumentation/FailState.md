# Double Jump
Whats a game without a way to restart?!
Here we will need to implement a way to detect that the player has gone where they should not go and move them away.
These are things we have covered previously, let re-apply those skills

# Possible Implementation
 - Store a Vector location for the player to move to(make it public)
 - When the Player actor overlaps the Teleport Actor you will want to Teleport the player to a location

# UE4 Engine Version
This project is using 4.20.3
