# Portal (Player Movement and Collision)
You have not yet noticed we have a whole other room with an exit portal on the other side. At the moment the portals are just aesthetic and have no functionality.

We will want to detect when the player touches the portal and teleport them to the other room


# Possible Implementation
 - Store a Vector location in the Entry Portal (make it public)
 - When the Player actor overlaps the Teleport Actor you will want to Teleport the player to a location

# UE4 Engine Version
This project is using 4.20.3
