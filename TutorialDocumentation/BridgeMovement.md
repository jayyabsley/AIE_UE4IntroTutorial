# Bridge Beneath The Fog (Object Movement)
The bridge to bring us home!

This bridge will require to be implemented at the same time as the button to take full effect!

We will be using some complex stuff here like Timelines, Lerping, and CustomEvents.

# Possible Implementation
 - You will need to create a custom event for the button to call
 - When the event is called you will store two values. The starting location of the bridge and the destination of the bridge.
 - You will then create a timeline to assist with smoothing the animation (optional)
 - You will move the bridge up from the fog so the player can cross!
